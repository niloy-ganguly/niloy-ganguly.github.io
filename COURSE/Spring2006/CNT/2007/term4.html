<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">An important 
property of networked systems is their robustness against removal of 
network nodes, through either random node failure or targeted attack. 
There are various kinds of complex graphs have been proposed in the 
literature. For example in the case of random graph (Erdos-Renyi graph) 
tail of the degree distribution decreases exponentially with degree 
k, making it unlikely to encounter a hub. Thus, there is a little difference 
between random failures and targeted attacks for this kind of graph. 
Another important kind of complex graph is scale free network where 
the degree distribution </font><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MathURL&amp;_method=retrieve&amp;_udi=B6TVG-4G7DY0S-3&amp;_mathId=mml1&amp;_user=450750&amp;_rd" target="_blank"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">p<sub>k</sub></font></a><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">, 
i.e. the probability of a node having <i>k</i> connections to other 
nodes, typically decreases as a power of <i>k</i>. It has been observed 
that complex networks with this kind of heavy-tailed statistics are 
highly robust against random failures of nodes, but are hypersensitive 
to targeted attacks against nodes with large degrees, i.e. with many 
connections to other nodes. So, relative to random graphs, scaled free 
networks seem to incur a penalty in robustness against targeted attacks 
in exchange for an increased robustness against random failures. </font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">However, a 
real network is the result of many different processes that may have 
little to do with robustness against node deletions, and it may not 
be desirable, or even possible, to make a substantial change to the 
network in order to increase a particular measure of robustness. It 
thus seems important to explore <i>already existing</i> networks to 
see if they can be simply modified to improve robustness against attacks 
without appreciably degrading either the network&#39;s performance or its 
robustness against random failures. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The goal of 
the project is to study such modifications, wherein either existing 
edges are randomly or preferentially rewired to connect different pairs 
of nodes, or else new edges are added randomly to the network. Such 
modifications decrease the network&#39;s dependence on its hubs, making 
it more robust against degree-based attacks. Two types of costs are 
incurred by modifying a network. First, there are costs associated with 
adding or rewiring edges. Second, if the network was designed to have 
particular properties for reasons unrelated to robustness, then a modification 
that substantially alters these properties may be costly. We can explore 
the robustness of the modified networks as a function of these costs 
and investigate which structural properties of networks determine how 
rapidly the robustness increases as edges are modified.  </font></p>
