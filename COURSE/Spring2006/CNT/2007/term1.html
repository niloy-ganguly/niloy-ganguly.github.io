<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Imagine that you want to 
send a sms-message to someone, but that there is no central antenna 
to route your message. Instead the message is going to be transmitted 
from one mobile phone to another, and eventually will reach its destination. 
Clearly the efficiency of such kind of service strongly depends on the 
details of the implemented protocol, but also on the structure of the 
underlying network of moving agents. The goal of this term-project is 
to explore the characteristic of such 
type of dynamical networks.</i></font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Proposed problem: </b></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Assume that each agent is a 
two-dimensional random walker able to receive a message, store it during 
a characteristic time tau and transmit it during such period to all  
its neighbors. Define that two agents are neighbors when they are separated 
by a distance equal or less than epsilon. Notice that an agent can only 
hold a message for a period tau after which the agent resets its memory, 
being able again to receive a new message. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Simulate N such agents using 
as initial condition that there is only one agent with the message, 
and characterize the structure of the virtual network of agents that 
have carried the message during certain period T. Characterize the network 
through its mean degree, degree distribution, and component size with 
respect to the entire system size. Define the degree of an agent i as 
the number of agents to which agent i transmitted the message (for the 
first time), plus one (corresponding to the connection between i and 
the agent that transmitted the message for the fist time to i). Explore 
the dependency of the network with T=tau, T=2*tau, …</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Remarks:</b></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The parameters of the model 
are: number of agents N, linear size of the box L (box with periodic 
boundary condition), radius of transmission power epsilon, and memory 
time tau.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Take into account that given 
N, L and epsilon, there is a critical value of the memory time above 
which the message persists for ever in the system (strictly true for 
an infinite system). Study the system above this critical value.</font> <br>
