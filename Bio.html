<h2>Short Bio of Niloy Ganguly</h2>
<p><br>
<br>
Dr. Niloy Ganguly is a Surojit and Sanchayita Chatterjee Chair  Professor in the Dept. of Computer Science and 
Engineering at IIT Kharagpur and a Fellow of Indian Academy of Engineering. 
He was a Visiting (W-3) Professor in Leibnitz University of Hannover for two years for the period 2021 - 2022. He has also spent 2 years as a Research Scientist in 
Technical University, Dresden, before joining IIT Kharagpur in 2005, and has 
risen to the rank of Professor in 2014. He has done his Btech from IIT Kharagpur 
and his Phd from IIEST, Shibpur. His research interests lie primarily in Social 
Computing, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Network Science. He has published in 80 
journals and 200 conferences, several of which are in reputed international 
venues such as ICLR, NeurIPS, AAAI, IJCAI, ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, CHI, WWW, CSCW,  ICWSM, INFOCOM, 
IEEE and ACM Transaction etc. He has served in the organizing committee of COMSNETS, NetSciCom, 
JCDL, WWW, DEBS 
CODS and IndoML. Prof Ganguly’s work has been recognized through awards by NSF, Cisco, 
NetApp, Samsung, and Yahoo!, among others. He has received prestigious research 
grants and projects, notably from Data Transparency Lab, IMPRINT, ITRA, Intel, 
HPE, Adobe, Microsoft Research, Accenture, BEL, and TCS. He has graduated 22 Ph.D. 
and 10 M.S. students during this tenure. He is the founding member of the Complex 
Networks Research Group (CNeRG), comprising faculty members, research scholars, 
and other students affiliated to the department. The group is a success story in 
itself, with several long-standing impactful collaborations, and presence in 
reputed venues across domains such as Social Computing, Machine Learning and 
Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Network Science, Networked Systems, 
etc.<br>

<!--<h2>Most significant research contributions of Niloy Ganguly
</h2>
<p><br>
<br>
Prof. Ganguly is one of the earlier computer scientists worldwide, who have 
made outstanding contributions in contextualizing the initial theories on 
complex networks proposed by physicists, and building customized services over 
them. He has applied network science on large dynamic social networks including 
Online Social Networks (OSN), Peer-to-peer (P2P) Networks, and Transportation 
Network. His recent notable works include building expert identification system 
in Twitter whereby trustworthy content can be recommended. He has also developed 
several classification and summarization tools to facilitate efficient 
utilization of Social Media during disasters. One of his important contributions 
is to build up a probabilistic modeling framework of opinion dynamics, and 
investigate to which extent incentivized users on social media can steer others’ 
opinions to a given state. He has also worked extensively on transportation 
Network to develop several services to enhance the quality of service of public 
transport in India. Applying network science in analyzing the physical 
infrastructure and traffic patterns of Indian Railways, and by modeling delays, 
he has identified most accident prone zones in India, and highlighted the 
systemic shortcomings in the current state of infrastructures. He has also 
worked on several theoretical problems pertaining to large complex network like 
growth of bipartite network, resilience of dynamic peer-to-peer networks etc.</li>
